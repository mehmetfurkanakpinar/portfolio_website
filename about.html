    <h2>🧑‍💻 A Little About Me</h2>

    <h3>🌟 Why This Page?</h3>
    <p><span style="font-size: 1.3em;">👋</span> I created this page to connect with you on a more personal level. <strong>While showcasing my technical projects is important</strong>, I also believe that <strong>who I am as a person matters just as much</strong>. After all, <strong>technical skills and enthusiasm alone don’t always make someone a great team member</strong>. I do my best work when I’m surrounded by people I enjoy working with — and I imagine you might feel the same! 🤝</p>

    <h3>🍻 Life After Graduation</h3>
    <p><span style="font-size: 1.3em;">💼</span> Since graduating, I’ve been working at a Wetherspoon pub to support myself financially without relying on my family. While I appreciate what this job has taught me — responsibility, pace, and resilience — <strong>it doesn’t quite feed my soul</strong>. That’s why I spend most of my spare time <strong>sharpening my SQL and Python skills</strong> and building projects to grow as a data analyst. 📈👨‍💻</p>

    <h3>🧠 From Psychology to Data</h3>
    <p><span style="font-size: 1.3em;">📚</span> If you’ve looked at my CV, you might’ve wondered what a psychology graduate is doing with a master’s in computer science 🤔 Well, I’ve always been <strong>deeply curious about people</strong>. Even as a child, I was drawn to <strong>understanding complex emotions and behaviours</strong>. Psychology was a natural fit, and I have no regrets about that path. But when I graduated, I realised that <strong>one-on-one therapy wasn’t the best fit for me</strong>. I wanted to do something more collective, more impact-driven. 🌍</p>

    <h3>🔍 Psychology & Data: Not So Different</h3>
    <p><span style="font-size: 1.3em;">💡</span> <strong>Psychology and data analysis share a surprising amount in common</strong>.</p>

    <p><span style="font-size: 1.3em;">📊</span> <strong>A therapist gathers data through conversation, interprets it using theory, and helps guide people. A data analyst? We gather, interpret, and provide insights to help people or organisations make better decisions.</strong> ✨</p>

    <h3>💚 Where I See Myself</h3>
    <p><span style="font-size: 1.3em;">🌱</span> That’s why I’d be especially <strong>thrilled to work as a data analyst in the mental health space</strong> — a place where my values and skills genuinely align. That said, I’m also <strong>open to gaining experience in other domains</strong> 🌍. Every field has something valuable to teach, and I’m <strong>excited to grow wherever I land</strong>. 🚀</p>

    <h2>🌟 Interests</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>🎬 I'm a huge horror movie fan. I especially enjoy discussing the storylines — I genuinely believe horror is one of the hardest genres to do well, and I admire those who pull it off.</li>
      <li>📺 Ironically, I’m also a big sitcom lover 😄 — I think <strong>Modern Family</strong> might be my all-time favourite.</li>
      <li>🌇 Watching sunsets gives me an abnormal level of peace. (Fun fact: I recently drove for 7 hours in a day just to catch one.)</li>
      <li>🪂 I’ve only tried paragliding so far, but I’m pretty sure extreme sports are my #1 undiscovered hobby!</li>
      <li>🎤 I have a soft spot for live concerts, especially Beyoncé’s. (Countdown: 58 days 😄)</li>
      <li>🖤 I recently got into charcoal drawing — surprisingly calming and really fun.</li>
      <li>🍻 One of my favourite things is catching up with close friends over a pint at the pub. I love the pub culture in the UK.</li>
